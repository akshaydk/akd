    <h4 class="_title">About Me</h4>
    <p>
      I'm a <span class="imp">Full Stack Engineer</span> with 4 yrs of experience in writing workflow applications. I started my career
      writing a Data Acquisition Framework in Java. After that, I moved into writing web applications in Ruby on Rails.  
      Anyone who has worked with me will usually tag me as an <span class="imp"> Extrovert, go-getter, highly energitic, team player,
      self-motivated developer.</span> I truly believe that Techonlogy is accelerating the human evolution and I am excited to contribute to it. 
      My personal projects and other contributions can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/akshaydk" target="_blank">github</a>. 
      Other interests include <span class="imp"> Running, Yoga, Traveling and reading non-fiction. </span> I ran a few half marathons
      and I am aiming to run full one in the near future. Currently, I'm on a break from work to explore new frameworks and expand my tech-stack.
