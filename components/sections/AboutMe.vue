    <p>
      I'm a Full Stack Engineer with 4 yrs of experience. After graduation, while working with UHG, I explored the alternate career
      options for few years and I've decided to write code for a living. I truly believe that Techonlogy is accelerating the human evolution and I
      am excited to contribute to it. Apart from professional work, I've recently started working on personal projects which can be
      found in my
      <a href="https://github.com/akshaydk" target="_blank">github</a>. Other interests inlcude Running, Yoga and reading non-fiction. I ran a few half marathons
      and I am aiming to run full in the future. Currently, I'm on a break from work to explore new frameworks and expand my tech-stack.
